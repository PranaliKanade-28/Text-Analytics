i hope @tgowdysc does better for rubio than he did at the #benghazi hearings which were a total disaster for republicans &amp; america! we need a real president!   looking forward to being in council bluffs iowa later today despite weather rally is on -- will be fantastic! #makeamericagreatagain! so i have spent almost nothing on my run for president and am in 1st place jeb bush has spent $59 million &amp; done run country my way! my campaign for president is $35000000 under budget i have spent very little (and am in 1st place)now i will spend big in iowa/nh/sc minorities line up behinddonald trump #trump2016 #makeamericagreatagain     @jessebwatters is terrific at hosting on @foxnews - he really gets it! remember that bill clinton was brought in to help hillary against obama in 2008 he was terrible failed badly and was called a racist! @leemiracle3: @foxnews @charleshurt @realdonaldtrump trump listening to voters unlike gop @umakemeill: @foxnews @jebbush @hillaryclinton @realdonaldtrump   @ijnipgm: no casualties just victory victory and more victory as you proclaim the truth that is in your heart we love god and usa @sunquist007: @jebbush why do u keep trying to attack trump? really dumb strategy!

#trump2016     thank you to a #trump2016 supporter for this video of my campaign- over the past 6 months video:   strange but i see wacko bernie sanders allies coming over to me because i\\'m lowering taxes while he will double &amp; triple them a disaster! wages in are country are too low good jobs are too few  and people have lost faith in our leaderswe need smart and strong leadership now! many of the great jobs that the people of our country want are long gone shipped to other countries we now are part time sad! i will fix! the middle-class has worked so hard are not getting the kind of jobs that they have long dreamed of - and no  effective raise in years bad if hillary thinks she can unleash her husband with his terrible record of women abuse while playing the women\\'s card on me she\\'s wrong! @borntobegop: @realdonaldtrump we need a real president to get things done and that\\'s why we want you!  thank you hopefully the republican national committee can straighten out the total mess that is taking place in virginia\\'s republican party fast! straighten out the republican party of virginia before it is too late stupid!  rnc @berniesanders-who blew his campaign when he gave hillary a pass on her e-mail crime said that i feel wages in america are too high lie! the voters the republican party of virginia are excluding will doom any chance of victory the dems love it! be smart and win for a change! rpvirginia has lost statewide 7 times in a row will now not allow desperately needed new voters suicidal mistake rnc must act now! it begins republican party of virginia controlled by the rnc is working hard to disallow independent unaffiliated and new voters bad! @mitchellvii: my prediction on the trey gowdy endorsement of rubio is that it will do nothing for rubio and finish gowdy i will do far more for women than hillary and i will keep our country safe something which she will not be able to do-no strength/stamina! thank you! #trump2016    hillary clinton has announced that she is letting her husband out to campaign but he\\'s demonstrated a penchant for sexism so inappropriate! a new terror warning was issued for european cties at what point do we say we have had enough and get really tough and smart weak leaders! #makeamericagreatagain #trump2016 story:     criminal deportations in the us are the lowest number in many years we are letting criminals knowingly stay in our country must change! the phoenix va it has just been reported is in worse shape than ever before the wait is horrendous and people are dying i will fix it the same people that said i wouldn\\'t run or that i wouldn\\'t lead or do well (1st place and leading by 21%) now say i won\\'t beat hillary @chucktodd is so dishonest in his reportingand to think he was going off the air until i came along-no ratings i will beat hillary! @cnn just announced that trump was #1 story of 2015 totally meaningless however if we don\\'t win it all and make america great again! @jodil792:  you know what\\'s making my christmas great family/food/friends&amp;you! i have my trump shirt on w/hope in my heart for america @jacobsac2015:  @foxnews thank you for your tweet today on christmas can\\'t wait to see you as president mr trump you are awesome when will the democrats and hillary in particular say \"we must build a wall a great wall and mexico is going to pay for it?\" never! our great veterans are being treated very badly because of corruption and incompetence at the va that will stop i will fix this quickly! remember when failed candidate @jebbush said that illegals came across the border as an act of love? he\\'s spent $59 million and is at 3% we have many problems in our house (country!) and we need to fix them before we let visitors come over and stay make america great again! does everyone see that the democrats and president obama are now because of me starting to deport people who are here illegally politics! @deedeesorvino was great today on @foxnews  she gets what is going on in politics and sees it very clearly have her on more! merry christmas to all have a great day and have a really amazing year together we will make america great again! it will be done! @danielhalper  great job on @cnn today very wise indeed! @halliejackson why didn\\'t you report hillary lying about the isis video bad reporting perhaps @nbc will do better next year-but doubt it! @yesmrgilbert: @nbcnightlynews @halliejackson should have talked to megyn kelly about this story  true a total distortion of the facts! i am now in palm beach florida and will be going to church tonight make america great again! @meetthepress and @chucktodd very dishonest in not showing the new @cnn poll where i am at 39% 21points higher than cruz be honest chuck! why isn\\'t @chucktodd using the much newer @cnn poll when discussing how well i am doing instead of the older q poll? cnn even better! wow because of the pressure put on by me ice to launch large scale deportation raids it\\'s about time! next year will be an interesting one i look forward to running against hillary clinton a totally flawed candidate and beating her soundly third rate reporters amy chozick and maggie haberman of the failing @nytimes are totally in the hillary circle of bias think about bill! wow even lowly rand paul has just past @jebbush in the new @cnn poll jeb is at 3% i\\'m at 39% stop throwing your money down the drain! in the ridiculous @jebbush ad about me jeb is speaking to me during the debate but doesn\\'t allow my answer which destroys him - so sad! poor @jebbush spent $50 million on his campaign i spent almost nothing he\\'s bottom (and gone) i\\'m top (by a lot) that\\'s what us needs! a great christmas movie &amp; perfect #tbt! #makeamericagreatagain story:     @ihatematt: @realdonaldtrump why is hillary even allowed to run she\\'s a criminal @ihatematt: @realdonaldtrump why is hillary even allowed to run she\\'s a criminal  good question! hillary said \"i really deplore the tone and inflammatory rhetoric of his campaign\" i deplore the death and destruction she caused-stupidity merry christmas &amp; happy holidays!#makeamericagreatagain #trump2016    hillary when you complain about \"a penchant for sexism\" who are you referring to i have great respect for women be careful! it is hard to believe i am winning by so much when i am treated so badly by the media  new @cnn poll amazing in all categories 21 pt lead why does @foxnews give @karlrove so much airtime he (and other fox pundits) is so biased still thinks romney won unfair coverage of trump @foxnews treats me so badly using old quinnipiac poll where i have a much smaller lead than the just out @cnn poll all negative! the @washingtonpost which is the lobbyist (power) for not imposing taxes on #amazon today did a nasty cartoon attacking @tedcruz kids bad the silent majority- is silent no more! remember the importance of voting!#makeamericagreatagain #trump2016   the hillary clinton staged event yesterday was pathetic be careful hillary as you play the war on women or women being degraded card #makeamericagreatagain #trump2016   thank you america! together- we will #makeamericagreatagain!   big news just out - new @cnn poll  trump  39 and leads in every major category likeability way up cruz 18  carson 10  rubio 10 we need a president with strength stamina heart and incredible deal making skill if our country is ever going to be able to prosper again! it is a shame that the biased media is able to so incorrectly define a word for the public when they know that the definition is wrong sad! when i said that hillary clinton got schlonged by obama it meant got beaten badly the media knows this often used word in politics! #makeamericagreatagain #trump2016   wow new reuters poll just out big lead if you want to make america great again!  trump 37  cruz 11 this is at the top of drudge! for those on tv defending my use of the word \"schlonged\" bc #msm is giving it false meaning-tell them it means beaten badly dishonest #msm npr\\'s @nealconan said \"schlonged\" to wapo re: 1984 mondale/ferraro campaign: \"that ticket went on to get schlonged at the polls\" #hypocrisy once again #msm is dishonest \"schlonged\" is not vulgar when i said hillary got \"schlonged\" that meant beaten badly jeb\\'s big ad buy against me paid for by lobbyists shows my face but doesn\\'t have me answering jeb\\'s statements he is really pathetic! watching @cnn and consider @secupp to be one of the least talented people on television boring and biased! women defy media narrative love trump at packed michigan rallyvideo:     @schoremis1:  @jebbush the donald should\\'ve been named man of the year he dominates the polls news talk shows &amp; social media maga! @qbeacademy: well i\\'m at 42% and your at 3% you know jeb you started over here you keep on moving further and further off stage  classic @jebbush\\'s opening and closing in the debate were said by all to be terrible--fumbled around incoherent why doesn\\'t @jebbush in his ads show my answer to his statement in the debate? will @jebbush in his phony advertising campaign show himself asking me to apologize to his wife in the debate? @jebbush just took millions of $\\'s in special interest money to look like a tough guy will never work! weak and low energy @jebbush whose campaign is a disaster is now doing ads against me where he tries to look like a tough guy @_msfl_: @realdonaldtrump @trumpusa16 a great patriot @philmonaco67: @realdonaldtrump 100% donald trump supporter go trump make america great again @daveandlouanns: thank you sir for caring for the people of america i was in newmarket nh office   @janienorris22: @realdonaldtrump got my autographed book yesterday can\\'t wait to read it you got them scared to death!

i won every debate so far according to all debate polls including @drudge_report @time @slate and more too bad dopey @megynkelly lies! between iraq war monger @krauthammer dummy @karlrove deadpan @georgezwill highly overrated @megynkelly among others @foxnews not fair! i am in trump international hotel las vegas getting ready and waiting for the debate tonight look forward -   hope i get treated fairly! i wonder if @megynkelly and her flunkies have written their scripts yet about my debate performance tonight no matter how well i do - bad! @megynkelly is very bad at math she was totally unable to figure out the difference between me and cruz in the new monmouth poll 41to14 @megynkelly the most overrated anchor at @foxnews worked hard to explain away the new monmouth poll 41 to 14 or 27 pt lead she said 15! why isn\\'t anyone using the @cnn iowa poll with me having a big lead they only want to use the one negative poll (2nd place)dishonest press isn\\'t it amazing that @cnn paid a fortune for an iowa poll which shows me in first place over cruz by 13% 33% to 20% - then doesn\\'t use it wow i just had two very good iowa polls and a phenomenal just out national poll from @abc @washingtonpost - 38%  make america great again!

melania and i just had interview with the legendary @barbarajwalters watch #abc2020 this friday tonight we talk isis @wntonight @ap is doing very badly i can say from experience their reporting is terrible &amp; highly inaccurate sadly they are now irrelevant! one of the saddest things in journalism is what happened to the formerly great @ap they have lost their way and are no longer credible what is our president doing?   gop voters trust donald trump to keep our country safe   refugees from syria are now pouring into our great country who knows who they are - some could be isis is our president insane? i along with almost everyone else have so little confidence in president obama he has a horrible attitude-a man who is resigned to defeat so many great polls like reuters - big leads everywhere new hampshire really special! we will win big and make america great again! thank you tennessee! #trump2016   just received a copy of @sarahpalinusa new book -- a great read! sarah is a terrific person great poll numbers out of @umassamherst thank you!

interesting article from highly respected wayne allyn root   remember i was the one who said attack the oil (isis source of wealth) a long time ago everyone scoffed now they\\'re attacking the oil @streetr77:  @johnlegere @tmobile didn\\'t know he was ceo of tmobile i have t-mobile it\\'s pathetic dropped calls no service tom brady just did it again he is not only a great guy he is without question the best quarterback! president obama just told president putin how important the russian air strikes against isis have been i told you so! @johnlegere  @tmobile  john focus on running your company i think the service is terrible!

#trump2016 they laughed at me when i said to bomb the isis controlled oil fields now they are not laughing and doing what i said #trump2016 thank you @jaketapper for giving me credit for my vision on bombing the oil fields should have been done long ago #trump2016 great honor to be inducted into the nj boxing hall of fame last night thank you! timing could not have been better!   @seanhannity  carly whose campaign is dead is making false statements about me in order to salvage hope! sad @carlyfiorina had to inject herself into my factual statements concerning ben carson in order to breathe life into her failing campaign! @carlyfiorina i only said i was on @60minutes four weeks ago with putin—never said i was in green room separate pieces—great ratings! @carlyfiorina  ben carson said in his own book that he has a pathological temper &amp; pathological disease i didn’t say it he did apology? @carlyfiorina carly—i did graduate from wharton and did very well who is your fact checker? will you apologize? @carlyfiorina carly not just you i also told gov kasich to “let jeb talk give him a chance” because kasich was constantly cutting in @drudge_report: reuters 5-day rolling poll: trump 34% carson 196% rubio 97% cruz 77% thank you - a great honor!

    @wsj and dopey karl rove made a mistake and purposely mischaracterized my statement on the terrible tpp deal  why does the failing @wsj write a false editorial about me and let dummy @karlrove make the same mistake in the same edition of the paper? @karlrove is a biased dope who wrote falsely about me re china and tpp this moron wasted $430 million on political campaigns and lost 100% we as a country either have borders or we don\\'t if we don\\'t have borders we don\\'t have a country! why wouldn\\'t the @wsj call for comment or clarification before writing an editorial which is so totally wrong no wonder it is doing poorly! when and how are the dummies at the @wsj going to apologize to me for their totally incorrect editorial on me i want \"smart\" trade deals the @wsj editorial board is so wrong so often they got info from an incorrect story in another pub why not watch and listen to debate @wsj editorial board should review my debate statement re china and tpp and apologize china not part but will get their way in later today\\'s @wsj editorial is wrong again i know that china is not in the new tpp trade deal but would come in latter through a back door i will be interviewed on @mariabartiromo @foxbusiness at 7:30 all seven on-line polls including drudge and time with thousands of respondents said i won the debate @krauthammer said i was \"so so\" @ellenespence: i\\'m not convinced that any candidate other than @realdonaldtrump is committed to securing our borders #votetrump2016 @borntobegop: @realdonaldtrump you will bring out more voters to vote for you than we\\'ve seen in any election!

would be nice if @jmartnyt learned how to read the polls before writing his next story probably done on purpose but not good reporting! @billkristol has become a sad case his magazine is failing badly probably doesn\\'t have long to go and his predictions are always wrong!

with ben carson wanting to hit his mother on head with a hammer stab a friend and pyramids built for grain storage - don\\'t people get it? such bad reporting: a puff piece on ben carson in the @nytimes states that carson \"is trying to solidify his lead\" but i am #1 easily! sad florida ethics commission advocate comes down hard on rubio so do two people who worked with him said he used the wrong credit card! sure @rhinostate: @realdonaldtrump @grundleman27 rubio is a manchurian candidate people will own him if he ever became president @aliceengle3: @realdonaldtrump-huge lead in reuters national poll   @grundleman27: marco rubio can\\'t even handle his own credit card how is he going to be able to handle the us finances #trump @reganharycki: @realdonaldtrump it\\'s about time we find a republican that can take on the democrats!   @deemcna: @foxnews silent majority did not try to kill their mothers like ben carson but wants america rebuilt by only one capable:trump a great honor to easily finish first in the @foxnews poll tabulation even though some of my best polls were not used in determining winner! @keksec_org: @realdonaldtrump ivanka said it and you said it too you\\'ll be great for women #makeamericagreatagain @chriskyleband: trump supporters aren\\'t angry we\\'re smart ! we\\'re men / women / millennials / politically saavy    @sandrajenners: i love to see the respect you have shown to your parents siblings and children proven respect and class needed in usa! the carson story is either a total fabrication or if true even worse-trying to hit mother over the head with a hammer or stabbing friend! @reagan_girl: msm are lying to you about hispanics hating trump here\\'s the real deal!  #hispanicsfortrump   rubio lied about my meeting w/ hispanic activists i didn’t change my opinion but treated them w/ respect shame!   @marklindsay78: @hanan_khan2 @realdonaldtrump poll numbers are higher then most think no one is asking democrats if they are voting trump @teamspringsteen: @realdonaldtrump i just finished reading crippled america it\\'s a detailed blueprint to get america back on track @curtismuddog: @destiny @seanhannity jeb\\'s!

by self-funding my campaign i am not controlled by my donors special interests or lobbyists i am only working for the people of the us! remember that i am self-funding my campaign hillary jeb and the rest are spending special interest and lobbyist money100% controlled hillary said such nasty things about me read directly off her teleprompterbut there was no emotion no truth just can\\'t read speeches! hillary clinton made a speech today using the biggest teleprompter i have ever seen in fact it wasn\\'t even see through glass it was black saudi arabia was \"vehemently\" against the iran nuclear deal then today they embraced it what happened? what did we give them to endorse? just announced that because of \"trump\" advertising rates for debate on @cnn are going from $5000 to $200000 a 4000% increasepay charity? why would a very low ratings radio talk show host like hugh hewitt be doing the next debate on @cnn he is just a 3rd rate \"gotcha\" guy! very low ratings radio host hugh hewitt asked me about suleiman abu bake al-baghdad hassan nasrallah and more - typical \"gotcha\" questions the dallas event in two weeks at the american airlines center is filling up fast get your tickets fast  before it is too late!

asians are very offended that jeb said that anchor babies applies to them as a way to be more politically correct to hispanics a mess! in a clumsy move to get out of his \"anchor babies\" dilemma where he signed that he would not use the term and now uses it he blamed asians jeb bush never uses his last name on advertising signage materials etc is he ashamed of the name bush? a pretty sad situation go jeb!

 make america great again the republican party must get tougher and smarter and fast or it will go down to a very big defeat - just like the last two times! a true piece about the standing ovations i got yesterday   the veterans administration is in shambles and our veterans are suffering greatly john mccain has done nothing to help them but talk john mccain called thousands of people \"crazies\" when they came to seek help on illegal immigration last week in phoenix he owes apology!

#factcheck #quithatin\\' wow @sharylattkisson  just wrote the definitive piece on what i said about john mccain   one of the reasons i am no fan of john mccain is that our vets are being treated so badly by him and the politicians i will fix va quickly via @fitsnews: “donald trump: john mccain is ‘a loser’”   why would anybody listen to @mittromney? he lost an election that should have easily been won against obama by the wayso did john mccain! congrats to the new gov of texas @gregabbott_tx for taking a tough &amp; bold stance at the border should have been done long ago by perry i have a proven track record supporting our veterans veterans deserve universal access to care va scandal proves politicians are inept that has served our country is put on a waiting list and gets no care it\\'s a national embarrassment that an illegal immigrant can walk across the border and receive free health care and one of our veterans i will make this right for our great vets! all he does is go on television is talk talk talk but incapable of doing anything john mccain has failed miserably to fix the situation and to make it possible for veterans to successfully manage their lives the veterans of our country have been treated like third class citizens for many years captured or not all our soldiers are heroes! in addition to doing a lousy job in taking care of our vets john mccain let us down by losing to barack obama in his run for president! just left family leadership summit in iowa got a standing ovation from many wonderful people i will be back soon statement on john mccain-   i am now in iowa getting ready to speak people are always amazed to find out that i am protestant (presbyterian) great the $10 billion (net worth) is after all debt and liabilities so simple to understand but @cnn &amp; @cnnpolitics is just plain dumb!

country want are long gone shipped to other countries we now are part time sad  will fix  the middle class has worked so hard are not getting the kind of jobs that they have long dreamed of   and no

needed new voters suicidal mistake rnc must act now  it begins republican party of virginia controlled by the rnc is working hard to disallow independent unaffiliated and new voters bad    my

not be able to do no strength stamina  thank you       hillary clinton has announced that she is letting her husband out to campaign but he demonstrated penchant for sexism so inappropriate  new

 with ben carson wanting to hit his mother on head with hammer stab friend and pyramids built for grain storage   don people get it  such bad reporting  puff piece on ben carson in the   states that carson  is trying to solidify his lead  but am   easily  sad florida ethics commission advocate comes down hard on rubio so do two people who worked with him said he used the wrong credit card  sure       rubio is manchurian candidate people will own him if he ever became president     lead in reuters national poll     marco rubio can even handle his own credit card how is he going to be able to handle the us finances       it about time we find republican that can take on the democrats        silent majority did not try to kill their mothers like ben carson but wants america rebuilt by only
